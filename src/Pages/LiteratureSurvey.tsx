                         Traditional medicine, which includes traditions such as
                         Ayurveda, Hela Wedakama, and Nila Wedakama, is
                         extremely important in Sri Lanka's healthcare system.
                         However, these approaches faced problems such as a lack of
                         standardization, competent staff, and access to modern
                         medical facilities. This requires the incorporation of
                         advanced technologies to improve patient care, increase
                         diagnostic and treatment accuracy, and maintain traditional
                         medical knowledge. This literature study focuses on the use
                         of technology in four important components. These are
                         disease identification and suggested doctors, herbal plant
                         identification and geolocation, handwritten prescription
                         recognition, and pressure point identification in traditional
                         medicine.
                        Technology integration with traditional medicine
                        practices can transform healthcare delivery, enhance patient
                        outcomes, and retain vital traditional knowledge. The
                        proposed research aims to improve patient safety, facilitate
                        effective treatment, and contribute to the advancement of
                        traditional medicine by addressing the challenges of accurate
                        disease identification, herbal plant recognition, deciphering
                        handwritten prescriptions, and precise pressure point identification.
 

                                <br /><br />
                                Traditional medical systems such as Ayurveda and
                                Hela Wedakama have been thoroughly researched for their
                                effectiveness in treating a variety of diseases. Ayurvedic
                                medicine has been demonstrated in tests to be useful in
                                controlling illnesses such as diabetes [1] and reducing
                                osteoarthritis symptoms [2]. In addition, examined the effect
                                of Ayurvedic medicine in the management of chronic
                                diseases [3]. Furthermore, machine learning-based
                                approaches for identifying and classifying. These studies
                                demonstrate the power of technology in illness detection and
                                recommend doctors according to relevant diseases.
                                preservation of medicinal plant knowledge is critical in
                                traditional medicine. Plant identification and conservation
                                initiatives have shown potential with machine learning (ML)
                                and geolocation technology. Machine Learning-based plant
                                identification approaches have attained excellent accuracy,
                                and the incorporation of geolocation data has aided in
                                mapping medicinal plant ranges.

                                The use of these
                                technologies in Sri Lankan traditional medicine can aid in the
                                conservation and identification of herbal plants.
                                Patients and healthcare providers face difficulties
                                recognizing handwritten Sinhala prescriptions. Previous
                                research investigated using optical character recognition
                                (OCR) technology to read printed text but ran into problems
                                with handwritten text recognition [4][5].Recent advances in
                         machine learning techniques have the potential to increase the
                         accuracy of manual text recognition.

                                The research on visual
                         character identification for manuscripts utilized deep learning
                         algorithms and image processing approaches to accurately
                         detect Sinhala characters [6].
                                 Hela Nila Wedakama discusses
                         the importance of identifying pressure parts on the body. AR
                         mixed with machine learning has been used successfully in a
                        variety of medical applications. For skin lesion detection and
                        diagnosis, AR-based apps based on machine learning
                        algorithms have been created [7]. Machine learning
                        algorithms based on disease-specific pressure point patterns
                        can give accurate forecasts and improve traditional
                        techniques such as Hela Nila Wedakama.The study of literature shows the possibility of
                        incorporating technology into traditional medicinal methods
                        such as Ayurveda, Hela Wedakama, and Nila Wedakama to
                        solve the issues that these systems must face. The research
                        covered highlights the efficacy of Ayurvedic and Hela
                        Wedakama remedies for various ailments, the successful use
                        of machine learning in plant identification and disease
                        diagnosis, and the use of augmented reality in pressure point
                        identification.

                                Despite these advances, there is still a need for
                    a comprehensive Smart Hela Wedakama application that
                    includes all four components (disease identification and
                    recommended doctors, herbal plant identification and
                    geolocation, handwritten prescription identification, and
                    pressure point identification).Previous literature has
                    concentrated on individual components, but there is a lack of
                    a comprehensive method that combines various components
                    into a unified application.
